# Introduction

[AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org) refers to NHGRI's cloud computing platform.  It is
built upon Broad Institute's [terra](https://app.terra.bio), which is built
on Google Cloud Platform.

Investigators contributing to the design and deployment of AnVIL are located at
various institutions.  The Bioconductor-oriented component of the development group
come from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, and
City University of New York.  This site presents material on the current
productions and plans of this group.
